# Email Parsing Script for Applications

## Overview

This Python script automates the extraction of pertinent details from emails and then posts this data to the KIRI API. This process requires careful consideration of the dataâ€™s structure within the emails and how it aligns with the API's requirements.

### Key Features

- **API Authentication (`get_token`)**: Authenticates with the `https://api.dev.getkini.com/token/` endpoint to obtain an access token using credentials stored in environment variables.
- **Send Application (`send_application`)**: Submits application data to the `https://api.dev.getkini.com/applications/` endpoint using the obtained access token.
- **Email Parsing (`parse_email`)**: Parses an email file to extract the body content and attachments.
- **Detail Extraction (`extract_details`, `extract_company_id`)**: Extracts specific details such as date, email address, name, role, reference number, and company ID from the parsed email content.

## Prerequisites

- Requests: `pip install requests`
- Beautiful Soup 4: `pip install beautifulsoup4`
- Python-dotenv: `pip install python-dotenv`

## Setup

1. Ensure Python and the required packages are installed.
2. Store your API credentials (`USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`) in a `.env` file:
   ```
   USERNAME=your_username
   PASSWORD=your_password
   ```
3. Paste `.eml` files in your Project
4. Select filename of the `.eml` you want to analyze:
   ```python
   main('application-1.eml')
   ``` 


   ```


Ensure that the file paths and credentials used in the script are valid and correct for your environment and use case.
